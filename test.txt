  Creating forms has never been simpler, thanks to shadcn/ui https://ui.shadcn.com
  and React Hook Form https://www.react-hook-form.com/. But what if we took it a  
  step further? Imagine if you could simply select the input fields you need, and 
  the rest was done for you—automatically:                                        
                                                                                  
  • Generate a Zod schema tailored to your selected fields.                       
  • Create complete form code, fully integrated with your chosen fields.          
  • Include validation, default values, and more advanced configurations.         
                                                                                  
  With just a few clicks, your form could be ready to go!
